Challenge:
Using Short-Circuit Evaluation can clean up your code a great deal. Update the following method to use short circuit evaluation. While you're at it, why not try reducing the entire method to one line?

def search_index(games, search_term)
  search_index = games.find_index(search_term)

  if search_index
    search_index
  else
    "Not Found"
  end
end

def search_index(games, search_term)
  search_index = games.find_index(search_term) || "Not Found"
end
